Based on your deployment log, I can see the issue. Your application deployed successfully, but you're getting 500 errors on authentication endpoints. The commit message actually reveals the problem:
"Enable persistent user sessions for production environments - Configure session management to use PostgreSQL in production and MemoryStore in development, addressing 500 errors on authentication endpoints by ensuring sessions persist across server restarts and load balancers when NODE_ENV=production is set."
The deployment shows NODE_ENV=production is set, which means your app is trying to use PostgreSQL for session storage, but there's likely a configuration issue. Here are the most common causes:
Likely Issues:

Database Connection String Format

Your DATABASE_URL in the log shows: postgres://postgres:Erka75810916%3F@a40ws8ccs8wwcscssos0css4:5432/postgres
The %3F is URL-encoded ? - this might be causing connection issues


Session Table Missing

PostgreSQL session storage requires a sessions table that may not exist yet
You need to run migrations or create the table


Session Store Configuration

The session store might not be properly initialized for production



Solutions:
1. Check your session configuration code
Look for something like this in your server/index.ts:
typescript// Make sure connect-pg-simple is properly configured
import session from 'express-session';
import connectPgSimple from 'connect-pg-simple';

const PgStore = connectPgSimple(session);

app.use(session({
  store: new PgStore({
    conString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
    createTableIfMissing: true, // Important!
  }),
  secret: process.env.SESSION_SECRET,
  resave: false,
  saveUninitialized: false,
  cookie: {
    secure: true, // Must be true in production with HTTPS
    maxAge: 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000
  }
}));
2. Create the session table manually
Connect to your PostgreSQL database and run:
sqlCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "session" (
  "sid" varchar NOT NULL COLLATE "default",
  "sess" json NOT NULL,
  "expire" timestamp(6) NOT NULL,
  CONSTRAINT "session_pkey" PRIMARY KEY ("sid")
);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS "IDX_session_expire" ON "session" ("expire");
3. Check container logs for specific error
Run this command to see what's actually failing:
bashdocker logs app-ass4ogowwogokcscs8oowogo-150859680759
4. Temporary workaround
If you need the site working immediately, you could temporarily set NODE_ENV=development in your environment variables to use MemoryStore, but this is not recommended for production as sessions won't persist across restarts.
Next Step: Check your container logs first to see the exact error message, then we can provide a more specific solution.
