  iOS Info.plist Template for USA Luxury Limo
  
  This template contains all required permission descriptions for Capacitor plugins.
  
  USAGE:
  After regenerating the iOS project with `npx cap add ios`, copy the permission
  keys below and paste them into ios/App/App/Info.plist before the closing </dict> tag.
  
  Alternatively, if ios/App/App/Info.plist is committed in git, it should already
  contain these permissions.
