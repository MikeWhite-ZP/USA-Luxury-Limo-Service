## System Architecture

### UI/UX
The frontend is built with React 18, TypeScript, and Vite, utilizing Shadcn/ui components (Radix UI) styled with Tailwind CSS. It functions as a PWA with installable capabilities and offline support. Role-based login provides distinct dashboards: passenger dashboard uses a professional light red/white/black theme matching main website branding with clean logo presentation (no gradient backgrounds or effects), driver dashboard uses a green theme, and dispatcher dashboard uses a purple theme. The design emphasizes a modern, professional aesthetic with consistent rounded corners and cohesive color schemes. All styling uses Tailwind utility classes, avoiding hardcoded hex values. Device detection and auto-redirection manage mobile and desktop views, with user overrides.
